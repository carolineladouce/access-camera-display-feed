# Access Camera Display Feed

This is my implementation of the [How to process images real-time from the iOS camera](https://anuragajwani.medium.com/how-to-process-images-real-time-from-the-ios-camera-9c416c531749) tutorial by Anurag Ajwani (thanks Anurag!).  This project is built using Swift and UIKit.

## What I learned 
This tutorial covers from top to bottom how to:

Access the front or back camera

Capture and display the camera feed to the user

Process images from the camera feed
